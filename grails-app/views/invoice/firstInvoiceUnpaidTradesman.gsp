<p>Dear <b>${company_contact_name}</b>,</p>
<p>The invoice that has been sent to <b>${customer_name}</b> remains unpaid and we have just sent them a chase up email.  Unfortunately in the modern world, people are sometimes dubious about clicking links within emails they receive. </p>
<p>Whilst we aim to make this as clear and easy as possible, it might be necessary for you to reach out to them directly and advise them to expect an email from us complete with the invoice and payment functionality.  Once they understand this, it should be very quick and easy for them to complete payment to you.</p>

<br>
<p>Yours Sincerely,<br>TradeRefer Team</p>
