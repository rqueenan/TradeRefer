<p>Dear <b>${customerName}</b>,</p>
<p>We’re glad you invited ${companyName} to register with TradeRefer however they haven’t yet completed their registration.</p>
<p>When you next speak to ${companyName}, perhaps you could mention the email that has been sent to them and explain how easy it is to use TradeRefer as, whilst we try and make it as clear as possible, they may be concerned the email is a phishing scam.</p>
<br>
<p>Kind regards,<br>TradeRefer Team</p>
